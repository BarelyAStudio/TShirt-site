# TShirt-site sample
a simple project of selling t-shirt using call to action,
made for a student client as part of my portfolio into transitioning to developing websites.

Used technologies:

> Mobirise: to make the general pattern of the website easily.

> Bootstrap: the default CSS library used by Mobirise.
